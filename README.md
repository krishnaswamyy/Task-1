 AI & ML Internship – Task 1  
Understanding Dataset & Data Types

Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset (`train.csv`)

---

Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Google Colab  

---

Task Description
The objective of this task is to understand the structure of a dataset before applying machine learning models.  
This includes identifying data types, checking missing values, analyzing target variables, and evaluating the dataset’s suitability for machine learning.

---

 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas  
2. Displayed first few rows to understand the data  
3. Analyzed dataset shape and structure  
4. Identified numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features  
5. Identified the target variable  
6. Checked missing values and data imbalance  
7. Evaluated machine learning readiness  

---

Target Variable
- **Survived** (Binary: 0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

---

 Observations
- Missing values present in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns  
- Slight class imbalance in the target variable  
- Dataset requires preprocessing before modeling
